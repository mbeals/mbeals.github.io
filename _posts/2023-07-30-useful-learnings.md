This post is a running list of useful commands, tips, and tricks I've learnt as I've been progressing through the [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) course by fastai. This is good practice for me as I learn Markdown syntax rendering from cotes' Chirpy Docs page [**Text and Typography**](https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/text-and-typography/).

## Bash Commands

**To launch a local server to test the Jekyll website** 

Navigate to the website root folder and type in ubuntu temrinal:
```bash
bundle exec jekyll s
```

## Jupyter Notebooks Commands

- `?` in front of any function gives the docstring
- `??` in front of any function gives the source code
- `doc()` provides link to documentation for that function
- when inside the parentheses of a function, click `SHIFT` + `TAB` to get the docstring (press more times for more info)
- `%` magic symbol runs terminal commands
- `%debug` runs the python debugger
