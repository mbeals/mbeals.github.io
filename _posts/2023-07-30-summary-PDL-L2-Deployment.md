This post summarizes my main takeaways from [Practical Deep Learning for Coders Lesson 2: Deployment](https://course.fast.ai/Lessons/lesson2.html) by fastai.

## Summary
- How to use data augmentation to increase the amount of training you can do on the same size dataset
- How to set up a local environment to run Jupyter Notebooks
- We actually deployed a working model out into the world! Mine is a cat type identifier between birmans, munchkins, ragdolls, and ragamuffins because I have trouble keeping them apart sometimes. Here is the [HuggingFace Spaces link](https://huggingface.co/spaces/michbeals/fastai_meowMeow_identifier)!
  + I followed Tanishq's excellent [Gradio + HuggingFace Spaces Tutorial](https://www.tanishq.ai/blog/gradio_hf_spaces_tutorial).
- How to set up a blog (hence why this exists)!
  + I am keeping in mind Jeremy's, Radek's, and Rachel's advice to start blogging early in the journey. Despite this slowing me down from progressing through the lessons, I can see how this will benefit as it forces me to recall what I've learnt and put it into practice 
  + I decided to customize a bit and not use the fastai template (mostly because I love dark mode so I looked for a dark mode theme). I went with cotes' theme [Chirpy](https://chirpy.cotes.page/) which has a great dark mode and good documentation + templates
